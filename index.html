      <h3>  To all the resillient IMGs </h3>

      <p> We salute you in undertaking a painstaking journey: to be the Licentiates of the Medical Council of Canada. We have trodden through the same path and feel your anguish. </p>
       
       <p>  The revised MCC exams are challenging because their objectives, syllabi, and patterns are uniquely Canadian. There is a lot of ambiguity for those who lack Canadian clinical experience. The IMGs feel unaided as the American resources are inadequate and the Canadian options are limited. We realize that the budget-friendly courses are outdated, and the quality of their content is suboptimal. We suffered like you, and hence after successfully achieving our own target, decided to extend a helping hand to others. </p>
       
      <p> We compiled this value-added course, learning from our lived experience, essentially on the Canadian content and the most updated guidelines. Crush QE1 is an intense exam-oriented course that walks you step by step through the entire curriculum while challenging your subject knowledge to the maximum, in the most MCCQE1 simulative fashion. Additionally, it focuses on honing the ethical /clinical decision-making skills required for scoring above average; a purpose that cramming a textbook cannot achieve. </p>
       
       <p> Prepare to be wowed by the testimonies of your fellow IMGs and, let us mentor you along this arduous path. We believe in you; all you need to do is to believe in yourselves ! </p>
